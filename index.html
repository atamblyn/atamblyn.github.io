Welcome to the eco girls website<br>
We are a groupe of friends about nine years old and we are concerned about the enviroment<br>
We will be adding poems and songs around the beggining of May or the end of April.<br>
Here is a sneak-peak at our featured song:
"Everybody should know that there are causes and effects
Everybody should know that the cause is oil spills
Everybody should know that the effect is animals dying"
